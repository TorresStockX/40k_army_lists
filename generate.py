"""
A warhammer 40,000 army list calculator.  You feed it a list of units with
their wargear options and get back a html page with a breakdown of the costs
and force organisation chart.  Units are output in the form of quick reference
cards that can be printed for convenience.

Input lists are expressed in YAML so that they are easy to read and write by
hand. They go in the 'lists' subdirectory.

Data for models, formations and weapons are stored in .csv files in the 'data'
subdirectory.

When you run this script, a 'docs' subdirectory will be created containing
pages for each army list in 'lists'.
